            <strong>Due to an ancient </strong>
            ongoing grudge between the Montagues &amp; Capulets, last night on July 1st, 
            a civilian named Mercutio Badabish were killed in a brawl on the streets of Verona.
            The main witness Benvolio explained that Tybalt, a kinsman of the Capulets, came to duel Romeo.
            In a heroic sacrifice Mercutio volunteered to duel instead of Romeo and died in the hands of Tybalt.<br>
            <span></span>
            The quarrel between the two families continues as Romeo: a Montague, Benvolio: a Montague, and Mercutio: a friend of the Montagues,
            went to a Capulet party which they were not welcomed in.
            Tybalt a kinsman of the Capulets came to duel Romeo for his arrogance, amiss behaviour,
            but Romeo wanting peace did not agree to the duel.
            Mercutio drew his sword instead of Romeo and began to fight Tybalt.<br>
            <span></span>
            They Began fighting to the death with Mercutio quickly gaining strength and about to slash Tybalt,
            but then Romeo intervened and wanted peace. He asked both sides to stop fighting.
            While Mercutio and Romeo were distracted, Tybalt cowardly stabbed Mercutio and Mercutio died with his last words being
            <i>"A plague o' both your houses!"</i>.

        Even though Romeo wanted peace; after Mercutio's despairing demise, he found himself track Tybalt and challenge him to a duel.
        With Romeo's anger to fuel him he quickly killed Tybalt and ran. Romeo was then banished from Verona for life.<br>
        <span></span>
        The quarrel between the Montagues and the Capulets started years ago before this town, fair Verona, was set.
        No one knows why it started but people believe that a Capulet once bit his thumb by accidentaly to a Montague.<br>
        <span></span>
        I interviewed the famous and great philosopher and scientist, Richard Asheton, to get his input. This is what he said:
        <i>"I do not believe that it was Tybalt's fault that Mercutio died.
        I believe another woman was on the scene with a black cloth covering her hair.
        And she used dark magic to control Tybalt's and Romeo's actions. It might be the Capulet nurse."</i><br>
        <span></span>
        The burial for Mercutio will be tonight at 7pm. Please come and wear all black. It will be raining so bring an umbrella.
